# Becoming-functional

Learning functional-programming can be hard, so i am starting with an easy practical introduction through this book:
Becoming Functional Steps for Transforming into a Functional Programmer (Joshua Backfield)
this book uses java, Groovy and Scala to explain the concepts, and Swift actually supports functional-paradigm too.
then practice unit-testing too.
